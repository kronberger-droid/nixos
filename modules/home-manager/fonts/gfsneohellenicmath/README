GFSNeohellenicMath v1.02, 18/07/2022
------------------------------------

The font GFSNeohellenicMath was commissioned to the Greek Font Society (GFS) 
by the Graduate Studies program "Studies in Mathematics" of the 
Department of Mathematics of the University of the Aegean, 
located on the Samos island, Greece.

The design copyright belongs to the main designer of GFS, George Matthiopoulos. 
The OpenType Math Table embedded in the font was developed by the 
Mathematics Professor Antonis Tsolomitis.

The font is released under the latest OFL license, and it is available from 
the GFS site at http://www.greekfontsociety-gfs.gr

The font is an almost Sans Serif font and one of its main uses is for presentations, 
an area where (we believe) a commercial grade sans math font was not available up to now.

The font contains an extened glyph set including more than the standard math symbols 
such as vertically extended integrals, chess symbols, etc. Vertically extended integrals 
are useful for large constructions although they are still not accessible by 
unicode-math (developement of this feature is in the works). To facilitate 
access to these symbols a style file is included (gfsneohllenicot.sty). 
Larger integrals are accessible with the commands \Bigint, \biggint, 
\Biggint, \bigggint. Smaller integrals, sums and products are also available 
with the commands \smallprod, \smallcoprod, \smallsum and \smallint.

This style file does two additional things. First, it scales the font to 1.2 of 
it's design size to match the xheight of GFS Didot if a serif font is needed to 
be used with it, and fixes accordingly the interline skip. Second it modifies 
interword spacing to 75% for a tighter look, and adds interletter spacing (tracking) 
to the \scshape command. Old style numerals are also accessible with \scshape.

Easy font setup is also available with the use of fontsetup package using

\usepackage[gfsneohellenic]{fontsetup}
